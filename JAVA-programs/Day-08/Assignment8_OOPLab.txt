Assignment-8 for OOP Lab

1. Write a program in Java to create two classes those implement an interface. The classes should provide different 
implementations of a method which was declared by the interface. Create two instances of the two different classes 
and a reference variable of the interface to call the method with different implementations. Also show that the 
reference variable does not have access to those methods that are defined by the class and not there in the interface
declaration.

2. Write a program in Java to create a class that contains a nested interface. Create another class that implements
that nested interface and thereby defines the method which contains only the declaration within the interface. In the 
main method create an interface reference variable to call that method accordingly.

3. Write a Java program to create a fixed sized stack using an interface and define the operations of the stack with 
the help of that interface.

4. Write a program in Java to create an interface. Create another interface that inherits the first interface. Create 
a class that implements this second interface. Show that this class must define all those methods that are declared
in those two interfaces otherwise a compilation error would occur. In the main method, execute calls to each & every 
method declared in the interfaces.
