same name and type signature as in the base class.Show that the
subclass version of the method overrides the base class 
version when called from, the scope of the subclass 
- Question 2:-> To create a base class and derive two subclasses from that .
 show that the methods with same name and different type 
 signatures are not overwritten but overloaded
 - 	Write a program to implement Dynamic Method Dispatch
 - 	Create a class TwoDFigure that contains data member to represent dimensions 
    and a method getArea() to calculate the corresponding areas
